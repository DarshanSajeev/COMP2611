- breadth-first,
– depth-first, with fixed action choice ordering,
– depth-first, with randomised action choice ordering,
– best first,
– A*

Ex 7:

Things to change:
loop_check
randomise
Change size of grid 
Change heuristics
Make heuristics
Change Node limit
No. of blocks
Cost

Track:
Total nodes generated
Nodes discarded by loop_check
Nodes tested (by goal_test)
Nodes left in queue
Log time it takes (graphs?)

Things that effect difficulty:
Initial state
No of blocks
Size of grid
Loop check?


First test:
4x4? and 8x7?
Change each algorithm
Loop check and randomise same
No of nodes the same 5000 and if fail increase by 5000
No of blocks the same 
Make good heuristic
Cost same throughout

First test:
Algorithms

Second test:
Size of grid

Third test:
heuristic

Fourth test:
No of blocks

Part B:
3 Conveyor belts all with their 

Parcels:
ID
Date
Priority: first or second  

Conveyor:
Locations 
How full
